# Hangman Game
This is a classic game of hangman, implemented using object-oriented programming in Python. The game uses the random_word module to randomly select a word for the player to guess. The player is given the option to guess a letter at a time, and the game will display the correctly guessed letters in the word, as well as the number of incorrect guesses. The game also includes a drawing of a person being hanged, which becomes more complete with each incorrect guess.

## How to play
Install the random_word module by running pip install random_word in your command line.
Run the script by typing python hangman.py in your command line.

Guess letters by typing them in and pressing enter.
